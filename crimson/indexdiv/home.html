<h1>CRIMSON</h1>
<h3>Not as evil as you were told</h3>
<br/>
<p>CRIMSON was created when Tyemi was still called DEFIANT. It used to be our most supported project, but it's mostly what the Tyemi PWA is going to be. For the moment it's the only way to access REVOLT, or the soon-to-be Tyemi single page Browser.</p>
